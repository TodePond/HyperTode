# HyperTode
I'm designing + making an alternative web framework for fun!<br>
HyperTode will be my JSX alternative.

## What's the plan?
🐸 Just-Use-Javascript™ as much as possible.<br>
🐸 3 state-management exports: `State`, `Hook`, `sync` (should maybe be its own library!?)<br>
🐸 1 transpiler export: `hypertode` (targets the state-management functions)

## Anything else I should know?
Yes.
