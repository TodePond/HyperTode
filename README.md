# HyperTode
I'm designing + making an alternative web framework for fun!<br>
HyperTode will be my JSX alternative.

## What's the plan?
🐸 Use the browser API as much as possible<br>
🐸 2 state-management exports: `State`, `hook` (should maybe be its own library!?)<br>
🐸 1 transpiler export: `hypertode` (targets the state-management functions)

## Anything else I should know?
Yes.
